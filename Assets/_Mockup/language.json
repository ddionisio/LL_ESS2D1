    "intro_1_0": "They appear to be frog-like. Let me put on my frog suit to communicate with these peculiar creatures!",
    "intro_2_0": "That’s better! Let’s see if they are of any threat…",
    "intro_3_0": "It looks like they have been exiled from their planet, and are looking for a new home.",
    "intro_3_1": "Well, we can’t just let them hang about in outer space. Besides, it’s not often we are visited by sentient beings, and frogs no less!",
    "intro_4_0": "They are expressing their gratitude, and are ready to cooperate.",
    "intro_4_1": "Well, why not? Let’s give these hapless frogs some proper homes to settle in. There’s still plenty of room here on Earth.",
    "intro_4_2": "Now commencing operation: Project Bloom – A quest for home!",
    "sunIllustrate_title": "Sunlight Direction",
    "sunIllustrate_hot": "Hot",
    "sunIllustrate_warm": "Warm",
    "overworld_1_intro_0": "This is the map of Earth. The frogs are very particular with their choice of habitat.",
    "overworld_1_intro_1": "We’ll need to determine where to place the frogs by looking at their criteria.",
    "overworld_1_criteria_0": "In this case, we need to find a place where it’s fairly warm and humid.",
    "overworld_1_hud_0": "On the lefthand side of the map are the latitude values. This is the angular distance relative to the earth’s equator.",
    "overworld_1_hud_1": "Now let’s view the temperature readings of Earth.",
    "overworld_1_temp_0": "As you can see, the temperature is consistently hot starting from the equator, and gets colder further north or south.",
    "overworld_1_temp_1": "This is due to the earth's equator facing more directly towards the sun.",
    "overworld_1_humid_0": "Next is the humidity readings of Earth. The percentage tells us the amount of water vapor in the air relative to its capacity based on the current temperature.",
    "overworld_1_humid_1": "Notice how humidity tends to be higher near the equator? This coincides with the temperature being high, allowing air to hold more water.",
    "overworld_1_humid_2": "It’s no wonder there is an abundance of trees in these regions!",
    "overworld_1_hotspot_0": "Now go ahead and find a place for the frogs to land. Simply press on the map to find the hotspot.",
    "overworld_1_hotspot_1": "Remember to make use of the temperature and humidity reading. ",
    "overworld_1_hotspot_found_0": "Now that you have found the hotspot, you’ll need to analyze its temperature and humidity readings.",
    "overworld_1_hotspot_found_1": "Remember to switch between the temperature and humidity overlay to analyze them both.",
    "overworld_1_analyze_0": "Looks like the temperature is too low. We will need to change when to land on this spot.",
    "overworld_1_analyze_1": "Since the earth rotates at a slightly tilted axis around the sun, the atmosphere can change throughout the year.",
    "overworld_1_analyze_2": "Why don’t we adjust the time by selecting a different season. Perhaps summer will give us the temperature to satisfy the criteria!",
    "overworld_1_analyze_3": "Remember to reanalyze the atmospheric readings when changing seasons.",
    "overworld_1_investigate_0": "Now you just need to pick a particular location on the land for the frogs.",
    "overworld_1_investigate_1": "When the majority of the frogs approve, we can finally launch the expedition!",
    "colony_1_intro_0": "In this scenario, we will be building the frog’s colony during summer.",
    "colony_1_intro_1": "Where it is mostly sunny, with some rain here and there. A pleasant weather to be out and about!",
    "colony_1_weather_forecast_0": "Here’s the weather forecast during this expedition!",
    "colony_1_weather_forecast_1": "The weather describes the atmospheric condition of a region within a period of time: how cloudy, how humid, and is it going to rain?",
    "colony_1_weather_forecast_2": "Remember that the climate describes the weather pattern in a region annually across 30 years or more.",
    "colony_1_weather_forecast_3": "So the weather we will be experiencing here over a few days will be vastly different several months later.",
    "colony_1_post_intro_0": "Our goal for this expedition is to populate the place with as many frogs as possible. We do this by deploying houses.",
    "colony_1_post_intro_1": "You can deploy a house by pressing the ‘home’ icon below, then pressing the ‘house’ that appears above it.",
    "colony_1_post_intro_2": "Go ahead and place one in a suitable location.",
    "colony_1_house_placed_0": "Excellent! Now that a house has landed, our population has increased by one!",
    "colony_1_house_placed_1": "In order to increase the population further, we are going to need food. These peculiar frogs seem to only eat a certain type of flower that they grow. ",
    "colony_1_house_placed_2": "To grow this flower, you just need to place it somewhere suitable much like you did with the house.",
    "colony_1_house_placed_3": "You’ll then need a gardener to nurture the flower. Simply click on the frog with a hat portrait when the green arrow appears.",
    "colony_1_house_second_0": "Now that we have a couple of houses placed, we will now need to sustain them with water and power.",
    "colony_1_house_second_1": "To build these structures, simply press on the ‘gear’ icon at the bottom.",
    "colony_1_house_second_2": "Press the water tank for water, and press the solar panel for power. Remember to place each of them to proceed!",
    "colony_1_water_solar_placed_0": "With both the water tank and solar panel placed, you’ll need an engineer to build them.",
    "colony_1_water_solar_placed_1": "To summon an engineer, press on the frog with a yellow hard helmet portrait when the green arrow appears.",
    "colony_1_engineer_placed_0": "The engineer will now proceed to build both the water tank and the solar panel.",
    "colony_1_engineer_placed_1": "That’s pretty much it! Remember to keep an eye out for each house’s needs as the population grows.",
    "colony_1_engineer_placed_2": "If you’re feeling confident, you can speed up time by pressing on the ‘play’ button found in the upper right corner of the screen.",
    "colony_1_vine_0": "Watch out! It looks like weeds are starting to grow on one of the structures!",
    "colony_1_vine_1": "Though the weather is ideal for the frogs, unfortunately so it will be for these invasive plants.",
    "colony_1_vine_2": "A gardener should be able to take care of these weeds!",
    "colony_1_mole_0": "A mole! These creatures don’t see very well, so they mistake our structures as something to dig through.",
    "colony_1_mole_1": "You’re going to need a hero frog to deal with these moles!",
    "colony_1_mole_2": "To summon a hero frog, simply click on the funny-looking frog with a red cape when the green arrow appears.",
    "colony_1_mole_3": "If your frog summon bar is full, you can unsummon some of the frogs by pressing on their portrait when the red arrow appears.",
    "overworld_2_intro_0": "Our next batch of frogs are keen on living in a windy environment, as well as hot and humid.",
    "overworld_2_intro_1": "In that case, we’ll need to check the wind readings of Earth.",
    "overworld_2_coriolis_0": "Notice how the winds tend to travel diagonally across Earth? This is due to the Coriolis effect.",
    "overworld_2_coriolis_1": "Since Earth spins from west to east, the winds in the northern hemisphere blow northwest to southeast, and vice-versa in the southern hemisphere.",
    "overworld_2_coriolis_2": "Let’s take a look again on the map.",
    "overworld_2_wind_0": "These are the general directions of the global winds. As warm air from the equator rises up, it cools down and sinks towards north or south.",
    "overworld_2_wind_1": "Sometimes, interactions between the low- and high-pressure winds will cause a cyclone, such as the ones you see on the map.",
    "overworld_2_wind_2": "These cyclones can become dangerous as it accumulates wind speed and heavy amounts of water, as it travels across the land.",
    "overworld_2_wind_3": "These are often called hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean, and typhoons in the Pacific Ocean.",
    "overworld_2_ocean_0": "One other thing to note is how the wind drives the surface ocean currents, which help regulates the temperature across the lands.",
    "overworld_2_gulf_stream_0": "Here is an example of an ocean current that brings warm water from the equator towards north, known as the Gulf Stream.",
    "overworld_2_gulf_stream_1": "The Gulf Stream’s warm waters maintain a relatively warm temperature in the nearby lands throughout the year.",
    "overworld_2_post_intro_0": "Anyhow, let’s find places where the wind might be strong. Try looking for areas prone to hurricanes, or typhoons along coastal regions.",
    "overworld_2_post_intro_1": "Remember to check the different seasons to see how the wind changes to various positions across Earth.",
    "overworld_2_post_intro_2": "This time around, there are more than one hotspot to discover on the map. Only one of them will match with the frogs’ criteria.",
    "colony_2_intro_0": "Looks like we’ve landed in a tropical climate. Where it’s hot and humid all year round with plenty of rain.",
    "colony_2_intro_1": "Though it looks like we’re getting more rain than usual, something is afoot...",
    "colony_2_intro_2": "Perhaps we should take a careful look at the weather forecast.",
    "colony_2_mushroom_0": "Uh oh, a mushroom has grown near one of our structures!",
    "colony_2_mushroom_1": "Since there's a lot of moisture in the region, the fungi that grow these mushrooms are able to absorb a lot of nutrients.",
    "colony_2_mushroom_2": "Their spores appear to be harmful to the frogs! Make sure to have a gardener around to take care of them!",
    "colony_2_fly_0": "Look out, it's a beetle!",
    "colony_2_fly_1": "Due to the consistent warmth in tropical climates, insects are able to thrive throughout the year.",
    "colony_2_fly_2": "These troublesome insects can be dealt with by a hero frog. Make sure to have one around to rout them out.",
    "colony_2_hazzard_0": "Take cover, a hurricane is heading our way!",
    "colony_2_hazzard_1": "As mentioned before about hurricanes: the wind speed that has accumulated over low pressure from the surface has reached critical speed.",
    "colony_2_hazzard_2": "Our frogs must take cover. Fortunately, their structures are made of sturdy stuff, causing it to withstand the staggering winds!",
    "colony_2_hazzard_3": "However, along with strong winds, the water that is released from the storm will cause flood across the land.",
    "colony_2_hazzard_4": "Make certain that no important structures are within the flooding area, or they will get damaged.",
    "overworld_3_intro_0": "Our next batch of frogs are looking for a warm place with low humidity, and some nice breeze.",
    "overworld_3_intro_1": "In that case, we should look for a desert climate!",
    "overworld_3_investigate_0": "Now it may seem that these frogs would want to bask in the sun all day long. ",
    "overworld_3_investigate_1": "However, they will still need some water source to sustain themselves!",
    "overworld_3_investigate_2": "Look for a suitable place where there are underground waters that we can extract.",
    "colony_3_intro_0": "The desert climate...This dry and hot environment will leave us with little to no water for our plants.",
    "colony_3_intro_1": "Fortunately, there are underground waters we can extract from to make this land more habitable.",
    "colony_3_water_0": "Since the ground here is not ideal for growing plants, we will have to do a bit of landscaping.",
    "colony_3_water_1": "First, we will need to build a water tank where water is accessible.",
    "colony_3_landscaping_0": "Now that we have a water source, summon a landscaper to irrigate the land.",
    "colony_3_landscaping_complete_0": "Excellent! Now that there’s an irrigated land, you can now place a plant on it. Do this now.",
    "colony_3_landscaping_complete_1": "We can proceed onward once we have increased the population.",
    "overworld_4_intro_0": "This is our final batch of frogs, and they seem eager to settle in the highlands where it’s cold and snowy.",
    "overworld_4_intro_1": "Why don’t we look for a spot in the mountainous area.",
    "overworld_4_investigate_0": "Although we are in an area that is mostly a tropical climate, remember that altitude can also affect the climate.",
    "overworld_4_investigate_1": "Go further up where the air pressure and temperature are lower.",
    "colony_4_intro_0": "The highland climate is quite comfy despite the consistent cold weather. We’ll need more than usual power to keep our houses warm.",
    "colony_4_intro_1": "Just like in the desert climate, the ground here is not ideal for plants to grow, so landscaping will be crucial.",
    "colony_4_landscape_0": "Since we can’t place plants on these rigid grounds, we’ll once again need the help of landscapers to shape the land.",
    "colony_4_landscape_1": "You won’t have to worry about where to place the water tank this time around.",
    "colony_4_landscape_2": "We will be able to proceed once the frog population has increased.",
    "colony_4_cave_0": "Uh oh! A cave has emerged from the ground!",
    "colony_4_cave_1": "Critters will keep emerging from these caves so long as it remains. Fortunately, an engineer can demolish it.",
    "colony_4_cave_2": "Make sure to also have a hero frog around to deal with the critters, while the engineers do their work!",
    "end_title": "CONGRATULATIONS",
    "end": "Project Bloom has been a great success! The space frogs are very grateful, and will return the favor in the near future!",
    "end_thanks": "Thank you for playing!",
