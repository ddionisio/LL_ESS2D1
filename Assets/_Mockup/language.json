    "intro_2_0": "That’s better! Let’s see if they are of any threat…",
    "intro_3_0": "It looks like they have been exiled from their planet, and are looking for a new home.",
    "intro_3_1": "Well, we can’t just let them hang about in space. Besides, how often are we visited by sentient aliens from outer space?",
    "intro_4_0": "They are expressing their gratitude, and are ready to cooperate in exchange for their refuge.",
    "intro_4_1": "Well, why not? Let’s give these hapless frogs some proper homes to settle in. There’s still plenty of room here on Earth.",
    "intro_4_2": "Now commencing operation: Project Bloom – A quest for home!",

    "overworld_1_intro_0": "This is the map of Earth. The frogs are very particular with their choice of habitat.",
    "overworld_1_intro_1": "We’ll need to determine where to place the frogs by looking at their criteria.",
    "overworld_1_criteria_0": "In this case, we need to find a place where it’s fairly warm and humid.",
    "overworld_1_hud_0": "On the lefthand side of the map are the latitude values. This is the angular distance relative to the earth’s equator (middle of the map).",
    "overworld_1_hud_1": "Now let’s view the temperature readings of Earth.",
    "overworld_1_temp_0": "As you can see, the temperature is consistently hot starting from the equator, and gets colder further north or south.",
    "overworld_1_humid_0": "Next is the humidity readings of Earth. The percentage tells us how much water vapor is present on air.",
    "overworld_1_humid_1": "Notice how humidity tends to be higher in large forest and jungle areas, such as the Amazon rainforest.",
    "overworld_1_hotspot_0": "Now go ahead and find a place for the frogs to land. Simply click around the map to find the spot.",
    "overworld_1_hotspot_1": "Remember to make use of the temperature and humidity reading. ",
    "overworld_1_hotspot_2": "Hint: we are looking for a temperate climate, perhaps somewhere in North America...",
    "overworld_1_analyze_0": "Looks like the temperature is too low. We will need to change the time of the year to land on this spot.",
    "overworld_1_analyze_1": "Since the earth rotate at a slightly tilted axis around the sun, the atmosphere can change throughout the year.",
    "overworld_1_analyze_2": "Why don’t we adjust the time by selecting a different season.",
    "overworld_1_investigate_0": "Now you just need to pick a particular location on the land for the frogs.",
    "overworld_1_investigate_1": "When the majority of the frogs approve, we can finally launch the expedition!",
    "colony_1_intro_0": "In this scenario, we will be building the frog’s colony during summer.",
    "colony_1_intro_1": "Where it is mostly sunny, with some rain here and there. A pleasant weather to be out and about!",
    "colony_1_weather_forecast_0": "Here’s the weather forecast during this expedition!",
    "colony_1_weather_forecast_1": "The weather describes the atmospheric condition of a region within a period of time: how cloudy, how humid, and is it going to rain?",
    "colony_1_weather_forecast_2": "Remember that the climate describes the weather pattern in a region annually across 30 years or more.",
    "colony_1_weather_forecast_3": "So the weather we will be experiencing here over a few days will be vastly different several months later.",
    "colony_1_post_intro_0": "Our goal for this expedition is to populate the place with as many frogs as possible. We do this by deploying houses.",
    "colony_1_post_intro_1": "You can deploy a house by pressing the ‘home’ icon below, then pressing the ‘house’ that appears above it.",
    "colony_1_post_intro_2": "Go ahead and place one in a suitable location.",
    "colony_1_house_placed_0": "Excellent! Now that a house has landed, our population has increased by one!",
    "colony_1_house_placed_1": "In order to increase the population further, we are going to need food. These peculiar frogs seem to only eat a certain type of flower that they grow. ",
    "colony_1_house_placed_2": "To grow this flower, you just need to place it somewhere suitable much like you did with the house.",
    "colony_1_house_placed_3": "You’ll then need a gardener to nurture the flower. Simply click on the frog with a hat portrait when the green arrow appears.",
    "colony_1_house_second_0": "Now that we have a couple of houses placed, we will now need to sustain them with water and power.",
    "colony_1_house_second_1": "To build these structures, simply press on the ‘gear’ icon at the bottom.",
    "colony_1_house_second_2": "Press the water tank for water, and press the solar panel for power. Remember to place each of them to proceed!",
    "colony_1_water_solar_placed_0": "With both the water tank and solar panel placed, you’ll need an engineer to build them.",
    "colony_1_water_solar_placed_1": "To summon an engineer, press on the frog with a yellow hard helmet portrait when the green arrow appears.",
    "colony_1_engineer_placed_0": "The engineer will now proceed to build both the water tank and the solar panel.",
    "colony_1_engineer_placed_1": "That’s pretty much it! Remember to keep an eye out for each house’s needs as the population grows.",
    "colony_1_engineer_placed_2": "If you’re feeling confident, you can speed up time by pressing on the ‘play’ button found in the upper right corner of the screen.",
    "colony_1_vine_0": "Watch out! It looks like weeds are starting to grow on one of the structures!",
    "colony_1_vine_1": "Though the weather is ideal for the frogs, unfortunately so it will be for these invasive plants.",
    "colony_1_vine_2": "A gardener should be able to take care of these weeds!",
    "colony_1_mole_0": "A mole! These creatures don’t see very well, so they mistake our structures as something to dig through.",
    "colony_1_mole_1": "You’re going to need a hero frog to deal with these moles!",
    "colony_1_mole_2": "To summon a hero frog, simply click on the funny-looking frog with a red cape when the green arrow appears.",
    "colony_1_mole_3": "If your frog summon bar is full, you can unsummon some of the frogs by pressing on their portrait when the red arrow appears."
